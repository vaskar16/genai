##This project is to create a POC on GenAI technology using Python, MYSQL and ChatGPT
#Below are the steps for setup with VSCODE
1. *Install Visual Studio Code:*
   - If you haven't already installed VSCode, download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. *Install the Python extension:*
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
   - In the search bar, type "Python".
   - Click on the "Python" extension by Microsoft and click the Install button.

3. *Select Python interpreter:*
   - After installing the Python extension, you need to select a Python interpreter for your project.
   - Open a Python file or create a new one.
   - At the bottom-left corner of the window, click on the interpreter version currently selected (it may show "No interpreter").
   - Choose the Python interpreter you want to use from the list, or click "Enter interpreter path" to specify a custom interpreter location.

4. *Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):*
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment for your Python projects to isolate dependencies.
   - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Python: Create New Environment".
   - Choose a location for the virtual environment and select the Python interpreter you want to use.
   - After creating the virtual environment, it will automatically be activated for the current workspace.

5. *Install additional packages (optional):*
   - If you need to install additional Python packages, you can do so via the terminal in VSCode.
   - Open the terminal (Ctrl+`) and use pip to install packages:
     
     pip install package_name
     

6. *Write and run Python code:*
   - You can now write Python code in VSCode and run it directly from the editor.
   - Create a new Python file (Ctrl+N) and start writing your code.
   - To run the code, right-click anywhere in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal" or use the shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Enter).

With these steps, you should have Python set up and ready to use in Visual Studio Code. You can write, debug, and execute Python code directly within the VSCode editor.
